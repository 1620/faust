**Simple**
    Faust is extremely easy to use compared to other stream processing
    solutions.  There's no DSL to limit your creativity, no restricted
    set of operations to work from, and since Faust is a library, it can
    integrate with just about anything.

    Here's one of the easier applications you can make::

        import faust

        class Greeting(faust.Record):
            from_name: str
            to_name: str

        app = faust.App('hello-app', broker='kafka://localhost')
        topic = app.topic('hello-topic', value_type=Greeting)

        @app.agent(topic)
        async def hello(greetings):
            async for greeting in greetings:
                print(f'Hello from {greeting.from_name} to {greeting.to_name}')

        @app.timer(interval=1.0)
        async def example_sender(app):
            await hello.send(
                value=Greeting(from_name='Faust', to_name='you'),
            )

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.main()

    You're probably a bit intimidated by the `async` and `await` keywords,
    but you don't have to know how :mod:`asyncio` works to use
    Faust: just mimic the examples, and you'll be fine.

    The example application starts two tasks: one is processing a stream,
    the other is a background thread sending events to that stream.
    In a real-life application, your system will publish
    events to Kafka topics that your processors can consume from,
    and the background thread is only needed to feed data into our
    example.

**Highly Available**
    Faust is highly available and can survive network problems and server
    crashes.  In the case of node failure, it can automatically recover,
    and tables have standby nodes that will take over.

**Distributed**
    Start more instances of your application as needed.

**Fast**
    A single-core Faust worker instance can already process tens of thousands
    of events every second, and we are reasonably confident that throughput will
    increase once we can support a more optimized Kafka client.

**Flexible**
    Faust is just Python, and a stream is an infinite asynchronous iterator.
    If you know how to use Python, you already know how to use Faust,
    and it works with your favorite Python libraries like Django, Flask,
    SQLAlchemy, NTLK, NumPy, Scikit, TensorFlow, etc.
