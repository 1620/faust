 Faust - Python Stream Processing
=======================================================================

.. topic:: \

    *“I am not omniscient, but I know a lot.”*

    -- Goethe, *Faust: First part*

**Faust** is a Python library for *event processing* and *streaming applications*
that are decentralized and fault-tolerant.

Heavily inspired by tools such as `Kafka Streams`_; and also
`Apache Spark`_/`Storm`_/`Samza`_, and `Apache Flink`_. Faust takes
a radically much more straightforward approach to stream processing,
and is extremely simple to learn and use.

The Faust API is used for both *stream processing*
(e.g., `Kafka Streams`_), and *event processing* (as provided by libraries such as
:pypi:`celery`).  It also runs a web server so you can optionally host your web
app directly from Faust, enabling you to rapidly prototype traditionally
complex web app architectures, in a simple manner that is also easy
to deploy and maintain.

To learn more about Faust go to the :ref:`intro` introduction page,
or go directly to the :ref:`quickstart` tutorial.
